            Please feel free to find a video of each project i have created thus far! i will be updating according to each project i undertake. Please note, all projects i have created are all and only used for learning purposes and not at all intended to resell.
            I have created each project based on each task i could learn for future use and for practice in the prospected fields, almost as a databank/resource bank, its there for me to learn on how i have progressed and what i can do for the next time and tick off each that i need to complete for the next project i take!

       This was my first ever project i was able to take on and with my sights set i went for a project where i could focus on one pivital point which is used in every website... API. Completing this project allowed me to learn the process of how to pull information of an API through the inspect tool and pull information and lines of code to create an api sectino in my "practice website."<br><br>
       I was able to achieve this through inspecting the running the api into the console log, pull information through said console and pick apart each aspect of the API card i wanted to display, the parts i pulled were the: image, comic issue, comic name and their release date. Thus when adding all of these aspects into its own styled cards, i was able to pull information of the latest comic releases and display them in blocks into front end on the website!

       I have left comments on the page on how it all works on each indidual file within the project which you can find in the below link to the repositorie of the file.

        Heading into my second project, i thought to try and tackle JavaScript, and the wonders that is functions. To actually make the most of these functions however, i sought out to try and create a project which would primarly work ONLY through functions, meaning making a web game!<br><br>

        Looking at this project i believe there is still more i could do, caping out the money, killing the page after the mecha dies or even trying to get the page smaller into a literal tamagotchi, however the purpose being education and learning, i was still able to create the project through a variety of different functions mostly through "const" (constant variable) and adding logic for how the health would tic health down every second and how it would then later effect the rest of the mecha.

        Probably facing my biggest personal project yet, i decided instead of having the plain old word document which everyone has seen by now of a CV template, it was time to create my very own website which would showcase me!<br><br>

        The idea behind this project was to show off myself, that includes all of my interests, hobbies, projects, CV and qualifications! on the technical side of this, the project would be to pour as much as my knowledge as i could of HTML and CSS to see how much i knew AND how much i could learn too.
        
        <br><br>

        First to pick out a theme (vapourwave) and to work around that and impliment what i can around this idea. Second was to get it fucntioning and working as i wanted it to. Third and finally was to get it working, and add on the finishing touches, but the best part about this project is, if theres a time i would love to come back to this project and redesign it i can! even make it better, but for now it was a showcase of my CSS and HTML skills!
